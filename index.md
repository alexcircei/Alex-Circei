# ALEX CIRCEI | **CEO & Founder** WAYDEV
## Welcome to my personal page. 

[The CEO Library about me](https://www.theceolibrary.com/alex-circei-12833.html) - "Alex C√Ærcei is the founder of multiple businesses, currently focused on building Waydev ‚Äì a software development tool that helps non-technical entrepreneurs better understand what their software development team does.

Waydev is dedicated to startups, technology companies, and digital agencies up to 30 employees. It‚Äôs a tool suitable for anyone who needs to work with developers, but finds it difficult to understand how their work is measured. Waydev uses weekly reports to keep its clients up-to-speed with the progress (sort of a Google Analytics for software development projects).

Alex is a serial entrepreneur, who founded and led several other businesses in the past decade, most of them related to the eCommerce space. He‚Äôs the CEO and founder of Copimaj, a digital eCommerce full service agency, through which he launched several other projects and services for brands.

He started by building an IT&C online store he launched 10 years ago, called LiveMag. He later started developing his own products dedicated to eCommerce: he launched Live2c, an eCommerce platform that helped small, local businesses create online shops integrated with their suppliers ‚Äì it was the first SaaS eCommerce platform in Romania, his home country.

A few years later, Alex founded StoreBeez, a marketplace platform that led to a 3-months experience at the Birmingham Oxygen Accelerator ‚Äì an intensive bootcamp for tech startups. Before leaving, he sold two of his previous businesses, LiveMag and Live2C.

Upon returning from UK, he went on and launched an email marketing platform called Lupsale at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2013 San Francisco conference. In 2014, after realizing a gap in the market, he built an accessible ERP (entreprise resource planning) and, one year later, he launched an invoicing app called BillMe.

One thing that helped build his business discipline is the fact that he‚Äôs an Ironman competitor. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term: Ironman is the name given to the long-distance triathlon races ‚Äì these are some of the most challenging endurance sports events in the world. It consists of a series of continuous sports trials: you start with a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, continue with a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride, and end by running a marathon (26.22-mile / 42.20 km), raced in that order and without taking any breaks between them."
